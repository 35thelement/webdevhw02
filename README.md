## Ben Romine's Calculator

### Instructions

Use this like you would most four-function calculators. You may input two numbers, with the first of them being negative or positive and the second being positive or negative. These numbers may have a single decimal point. You may input a single operation, which is one of +, -, \*, or /. You may enter + by pressing the +/= button. This operation will be placed between the two numbers, and not at the end of a single number without a second number following it. You may calculate the result of your equation by pressing the +/= button when there are two numbers present with an operation in between them. You may not use the result of an equation for further calculations.

However, you cannot subtract a negative number from a negative number. This is because the same operation can be done by adding a positive number to a negative number.
